# ReturnOOF

Due to the Roblox corperation(A $38,000,000,000 company) not paying the original creator of the classic "OOF" sound $10,000 they have removed the OOF death sound with their own. Using this simple script you can get your beautiful OOF sound back.

### Tutorial

- Find your roblox directory(Right click your roblox shortcut and click open file location)
The roblox directory should look something like this: 
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\version-31b938635c234124
- Open ReturnOOF
- Paste (CTRL + V) into the console.
- Click enter
- If a success message shows then your glorious OOF sound is back. :)
